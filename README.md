Applications of Matrices and its manipulation in the field of Machine Learning
Introduction
Matrices are fundamental structures in mathematics and are widely used across various fields, including physics, computer science, and economics. In the realm of machine learning, matrices are essential for representing and manipulating large volumes of data, making them indispensable for many core algorithms and techniques. From data representation to efficient computations, matrices allow machine learning models to perform operations such as transformations, optimizations, and decompositions, which are crucial for extracting meaningful insights from data.
This project focuses on the applications of matrices and their manipulation in the field of machine learning. Specifically, it explores three key applications, each of which leverages different matrix operations to achieve various tasks:
1. Reconstruction and Compression of Colour Image Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA is a powerful technique that uses matrix manipulations to reduce the dimensionality of data, making it useful for tasks like image compression. By decomposing the data matrix into principal components that capture the most significant variance, PCA enables the reconstruction of the data using fewer components, thereby compressing the data while retaining most of the important information
2. Linear Regression via QR Decomposition:
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. QR decomposition, a matrix factorization technique, can be applied to solve the normal equation in linear regression in a more numerically stable way than direct inversion of the matrix. 
3. Black and White Image Compression Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is another crucial matrix decomposition technique that is widely used in machine learning for tasks like dimensionality reduction and data compression. In this application, SVD is applied to compress grayscale (black and white) images by approximating the original data matrix with a smaller rank, thus reducing the amount of data needed to store or transmit the image
Through these applications, this project highlights how matrices not only serve as data representations but also play a critical role in optimizing and enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms. Each application is accompanied by code implementations that demonstrate the practical use of these matrix operations in real-world machine learning tasks, providing a hands-on understanding of the versatility and power of matrix computations in this ever-evolving field.
